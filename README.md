# Sport-Leagues-Analysis


In this study, I analyzed a dataset of FIFA 22 players obtained from [kaagle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juniorverli/fifa-22-all-normal-players-from-ultimate-team?). The primary aim was to identify the top-performing player for each position and assemble optimal teams for the leading European football leagues, which include the Premier League, LaLiga Santander, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1. By leveraging statistical analysis and machine learning methods, I assessed various player performance metrics to construct the most competitive squads for each league.
